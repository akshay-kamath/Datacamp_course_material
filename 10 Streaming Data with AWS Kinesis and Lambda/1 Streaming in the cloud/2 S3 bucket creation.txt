Amazon's ARNs or Amazon Resource Names for buckets follow a specific format. Let's practice generating ARNs for various S3 buckets.

The S3 client has been created and stored in the s3 variable.

Instructions

Create the new "sd-vehicle-data" bucket.
List the buckets available in S3.
Generate the ARN for each bucket and print it.

# Create the new sd-vehicle-data bucket
s3.create_bucket(Bucket='sd-vehicle-data')

# List the buckets in S3
for bucket_info in s3.list_buckets()['Buckets']:
    
    # Get the bucket_name
    bucket_name = bucket_info['Name']
    
    # Generate bucket ARN.
    arn = "arn:aws:s3:::{}".format(bucket_name)
    
    # Print the ARN
    print(arn)
	
	
<script.py> output:
    arn:aws:s3:::logs-bucket
    arn:aws:s3:::samples-bucket
    arn:aws:s3:::sd-vehicle-data
